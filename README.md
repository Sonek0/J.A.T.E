# 19 Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

## MyTask

As I have progressed through this course, I tried to put together a number of impressive projects that I can show off to potential employers. This project is no exception; in fact, it features some of the most impressive expressions of the concepts I have learned so far.

My task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
